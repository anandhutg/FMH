✅ Fix Summary: Angular Project Page Not Showing Content

🔧 Issue Faced:
- After `ng build`, deployed app showed “Page Not Found”.
- `index.html` was missing in the `dist/` folder.
- Firebase or browser reported: “This file does not exist and there was no index.html found...”
- Angular build failed with errors like:  
  - `Property main is not allowed.`
  - `No loader configured for .html`
  - `Could not find builder '@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser'`
  - `Must have required property 'outputPath'`

✅ Fixes You Applied (Step-by-Step)

1. 🛠️ Corrected `angular.json` Configuration
   - Used the correct builder:
     "builder": "@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser"
   - Added required options:
     "main": "src/main.ts",
     "index": "src/index.html",
     "outputPath": "dist/fmh"

2. 🧹 Cleaned Node Modules and Reinstalled Dependencies
   - Remove old dependencies:
     Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules
     Remove-Item -Force package-lock.json
     npm install

3. 🧩 Verified Required Angular Packages
   - Ensured `@angular-devkit/build-angular` is installed:
     npm install --save-dev @angular-devkit/build-angular

4. 🏗️ Rebuilt the Project Properly
   - Build using production configuration:
     ng build --configuration production

5. 🚀 Ensured Firebase is Serving Correct Output

- Firebase now serves the Angular application successfully.
- Deployed website displays your content properly.
